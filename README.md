<h1>U.S. County-Level Data Retrieval from the ACS-5 API & basic Data Exploration</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<b>This project stems from my masterâ€™s thesis research, which involved conducting Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) of county level ACS-5 data. Throughout this process, a significant observation emerged: notable disparities exist in the data quality across various regions and variables. A prevailing trend indicates that sparsely populated counties and more specialized variables tend to exhibit lower data quality. To comprehensively understand data quality, streamline the creation of a geoJSON data frame, and gain insights into variables (spatial) distributions and relationships, four distinct functions were developed.

The initial function serves as the primary tool for users, facilitating the retrieval of county-level data from the ACS-5 API. It provides insights into data quality while seamlessly generating a geoJSON data frame. Function 2 automates the creation of boxplots, offering visual representations of the data's distribution. Function 3 generates a scatterplot matrix, allowing users to explore bivariate relationships among variables. Lastly, function 4 produces basic maps displaying variable values for each county across the contiguous USA, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.
